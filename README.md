A simple Python-based wifi (or anything, really!) password dictionary generator.

## Usage
`python3 wifigen.py -t <type> -l <length> -o <filename>`

Supported dictionary types:
+ Numeric
+ Alphabetic
+ Alphanumeric

Please note that wifigen does not overwrite already existing files, so a new filename is needed in order to generate a dictionary successfully.
